  title: "Renamed Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Major Expansion",
  longText: `Ngee Ann Technical College was formally renamed Ngee Ann Polytechnic on 19 March 1982, as announced by the Minister-in-charge of the Polytechnic, Dr Tay Eng Soon. During the press conference, the Minister also announced NP’s second five-year expansion plan. A model of the expanded campus and its new buildings was displayed, showcasing new classroom, workshop and laboratory blocks, office cum teaching blocks, lecture theatres, a student activities centre, Administration cum Library Block and canteens. These were approved by the Government under the main building project in 1981, as well as the three proposed staff accommodation blocks and the proposed Sports Complex.

A new component was also added to the expansion plan with the decision to establish a Centre for Computer Studies in the Polytechnic. This was formally established in July 1982 and became a project of national significance. The centre aimed to provide training in computer studies at the high standard required for computer activities throughout Singapore. The importance of the students being awarded an internationally accepted qualification was also recognised. Hence, the Computer Studies course was structured in a way that the graduates would, in addition to the Polytechnic Diploma, also receive the BTEC (Business and Technician Education Council) Higher National Diploma (HND) in Computer Studies, awarded in the United Kingdom. The centre was also granted exemption from the Part I Examination of the British Computer Society.

In the same year, the Council on Professional and Technical Education (CPTE) revised its projection of NP’s student enrolment. The new projection indicated that by 1986, the Mechanical and Electrical & Electronic courses would have a total of 6000 students, the Building Maintenance & Management (formerly known as Building Services) and the Shipbuilding & Repair Technology courses would have a total of 800 students, the Business Studies with 1600 students and the newly established Centre for Computer Studies with 600 students. The total projected figure was 9000, 3000 more than the figure given by the CPTE in 1979. This made the expansion project extremely critical to meet the tremendous increase in enrolment.

The Works and Buildings and the Furniture and Equipment components of the physical aspect of the Expansion Plan were completed first. Works and Buildings covered the teaching facilities and infrastructure, such as roads, car parks, linkways, bridges, drainage systems, etc. A sum of $163.38m was approved by the Ministry of Finance for this component. For the Furniture and Equipment component, a sum of $54.5M was approved for the purchase and installation of new furniture and equipment for the new classrooms, offices, laboratories and workshops.`,
