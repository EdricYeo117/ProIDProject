  longText: `Founded in 1963 as the Ngee Ann College by the Ngee Ann Kongsi, Ngee Ann Polytechnic opened with 116 students and offered courses in language, commerce and technology. (Ngee Ann Polytechnic, n.d.) It was established at the newly-built Teochew Building at Tank Road with Professor Liu Yin Soon as its first principal.

Background:
As a result of Nanyang University not fulfilling the dreams of creating a “Chinese University” with high academic standards to serve all the Chinese throughout Southeast Asia, a handful of the University’s senior staff broke away to create another centre of higher learning.

On Saturday 25 May 1963, at 2pm, Ngee Ann College was inaugurated. To show support for the newfound college, the Singapore Government decided to extend generous bursaries to students admitted to the college. Ngee Ann College was seen as an alternative to Nanyang University, with the founders dedicating themselves to providing higher education for the Chinese, aspiring to create an institute committed to high academic standards and one which would avoid domination by the communists.

The three main goals of academic training to be given to all students, originally highlighted by the then principal, Liu Yin Soon, were as follows:
1. To promote the founding of the great Malaysian culture
2. To lay equal emphasis on theoretical knowledge and practical skill
3. To stress the training of sound ideology and morality

The departments formed at the time included the Chinese and Malay language departments under the Language division, the Accountancy and Business Administration departments under the Commerce division, and the Applied Chemistry, Telecommunication Engineering and Home Economics departments under the Technology division.

The College had an initial number of 36 members on the teaching staff, comprising 20 full-time and 16 part-time staff members.`,
