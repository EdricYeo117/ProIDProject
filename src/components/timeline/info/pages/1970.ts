  title: "Shift to Technical Education Focus",
  tag: "Reorganisation",
  longText: `In 1970, the departments of Business Administration, Accountancy, Applied Chemistry, Telecommunications Engineering, Home Economics and part-time courses in Chinese Literature and Accountancy were discontinued. The last batch of 105 degree students under the old system sat for their graduation examination and left the college in 1970.

In April 1970, Ngee Ann Technical College commenced its academic year with only three departments – Mechanical Engineering, Industrial Electronics and Commerce. There were 100 first-year students and 65 second-year students in the Mechanical Engineering department, 73 first-year students in the Industrial Electronics department, and 157 first-year students in the Commerce department. This shift was a result of a need for suitably trained manpower in industry and commerce, causing the Government to reorganize the entire educational system to focus on technical education as a long term measure.

In March 1970, the Principal of eight years, Liu Yin Soon, tendered her resignation. After her resignation, her role was not filled until 9 November 1970, where then Parliamentary Secretary to the Education Ministry, Dr Lee Chiaw Meng took over the duties of Principal.

By October 1970, student enrolment totalled 754 students, with 341 in Mechanical Engineering, 176 in Industrial Electronic Engineering, and 237 in Commerce. The student population was expected to increase to 3000 by 1974. The lecturing staff totalled 26, resulting in a staff to student ratio of 1:29. The staff strength was predicted to increase to 120 by 1974.

In light of the predicted increase in students and staff numbers, the NATC embarked on its first five-year extension plan, with an $11M estimate. This was to support a physical expansion on land obtained by the Kongsi, which would later be implemented in two phases. Phase I involved a total building area of 8370 square meters, consisting of Engineering workshops and fully-equipped laboratories, as well as an extension of the Library and Canteen. Phase II involved a total building area of 10235 square meters, consisting of three interlinked blocks of classrooms, three lecture theatres with a combined seating capacity of 570, an academic staff lounge and staff offices, and a multi-purpose hall and Student Centre. After completion of the expansion, the College campus was expected to cover an area of 16 hectares.

In addition to the physical changes to the college, the plan also included a staff development and expert services programme which made available fellowships and overseas training and attachments to local staff, enabling the college to obtain expert services in curriculum and staff development. The medium of instruction was also changed from Chinese to English, and with this brought about the admission of non-Chinese students to its courses in April 1971.`,
