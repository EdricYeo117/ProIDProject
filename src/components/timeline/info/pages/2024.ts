  longText: `As part of NP’s 60th anniversary, the Polytechnic announced its 5th Strategic Plan, or NP2030, which shares the Polytechnic’s vision and outlines its priorities and strategies for a shared and sustainable future.

NP became the first institute of higher learning with an autonomous shuttle service serving its campus with the launch of the MooBus through a partnership with autonomous driving software technology provider MooVita Pte Ltd.

With the increasing pace of technological adoption and disruption across industries, NP announced the launch of its new Industry-in-Curriculum (IiC) framework at its inaugural Industry Partners Appreciation Day graced by Minister for Education Mr Chan Chun Sing. The framework underscored NP’s efforts in further aligning students’ learning with the latest industry developments, so that students will graduate with in-demand skill sets and industry validated competencies.

NP unveiled the M:idea Playground, an immersive on-campus space. Graced by Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and National Development, Ms Sim Ann, the event marked NP’s initiative in pioneering virtual production training, one of the most sought-after skills in content creation.

NP and Yinson GreenTech jointly unveiled green technology infrastructure on NP's campus, comprising an IoT-enabled smart energy management technology centre called synergy.lab, a solar farm and electric vehicle charging facilities powered by renewable energy. The purpose-built green infrastructure serves as a ‘living lab’ for students to explore real-world engineering solutions in green and smart mobility. The official launch ceremony was graced by Acting Minister for Transport Mr Chee Hong Tat.`,
