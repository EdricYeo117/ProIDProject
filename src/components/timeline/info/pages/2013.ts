  longText: `In 2013, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled a blueprint that set out NP’s 10-year plan to reinvent itself and better prepare students to thrive in the global workplace. Launched at NP’s 50th anniversary event, the Polytechnic shared its 4th Strategic Plan, which spanned from 2013–2022.

Following a 2011 affiliation with NTU for engineering, 2013 saw further investment in facilities for well-rounded student development. NP also began pioneering various environmental sustainability initiatives and was recognised for its green campus efforts.`,
